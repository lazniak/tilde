  "lighting_mood": "High-contrast chiaroscuro characterized by a violent duality between organic and artificial light. Exterior scenes utilize blinding, high-key natural sunlight (overexposed to wash out detail into 'geometry') creating sharp, razor-edged shadows. Interior scenes rely on 'pitch black' darkness punctured by rhythmic, mechanical stroboscopic flashes synced to the industrial percussion. The aesthetic creates an 'analog glitch' effect through in-camera heavy backlighting, lens whacking to induce spectral flares, and reflection off mirrors/prisms to split white light into chromatic edges, emphasizing the metaphysical dissolution of the subject."
