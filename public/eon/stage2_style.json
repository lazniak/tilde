    "style_instruction": "Cinematic Analog Surrealism and Brutalist Minimalism. A raw, organic aesthetic achieved strictly through practical effects and in-camera optical engineering (prisms, mirrors, refraction) to simulate 'glitch' and 'digital' visuals without CGI. The imagery juxtaposes vast, barren high-key landscapes (salt flats, deserts) with cold, low-key industrial interiors (concrete bunkers, quarries). Lighting relies on harsh chiaroscuro, natural solar flares, and mechanical stroboscopic effects. The color palette is earthy and desaturated (sand, slate grey, bone white, deep black), punctuated by spectral light leaks and the vibrant blue of the sky. High-speed cinematography emphasizes texture—shifting dust, rippling sheer fabric, and water droplets—capturing Butoh-inspired movement to visualize the metaphysical dissolution of the human form into geometry and light."
